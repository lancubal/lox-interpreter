1. Ideally, we would have an actual abstraction, some kind of “ErrorReporter” interface that gets passed to the scanner and parser so that we can swap out different reporting strategies. For our simple interpreter here, I didn’t do that, but I did at least move the code for error reporting into a different class.
2. Sacar imports estaticos
3. The code reports each invalid character separately, so this shotguns the user with a blast of errors if they accidentally paste a big blob of weird text. Coalescing a run of invalid characters into a single error would give a nicer user experience
4. Unit tests
